1.1.2

- Updated portrait Targets to the new ones used by TDIT so the portrait replacements work again.
- Changed folder name from "(TDIT) Island Trader Sialia Portrait" to "[CP] IslandTraderSialiaPortrait" to adhere to usual modmaking convention.

1.1.1

- Fixed bug where the green bird from TDIT would appear in front of Sialia if TDIT's island trader rotation was enabled. Added French and Spanish translations (thanks to Mazout and Koda).

1.1.0

- Added sprite replacement option - by default, this mod now replaces the vanilla Island Trader sprite with a copy of the original sprite made by Emyn for EDGI. The sprite itself has not been changed from EDGI but I have edited the canvas size to prevent the bird's animation from being visible behind the human sprite.
- Added brown hair as a variant. Choosing brown hair in the options will also set the sprite to an edited version with brown hair.
