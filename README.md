# AbaStardewModsPublic
Public repo containing my published Stardew Valley mods.

Do not download these mods from here if you want to play with them. Download them from [Nexus Mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Abagaianye/mods) instead. Mods are stored here for backup and so that people can access my source code for C#.

My mods are usually licensed MIT for C# code. Any non-code assets created by me (e.g., images, audio, non-code text) may not be shared (whether edited or not) without my permission. Personal edits that are not shared with any other person are okay. Any assets included in my mods that were not created by me will have their permissions listed in the mod files. Check the LICENSE file in each mod for more information.
